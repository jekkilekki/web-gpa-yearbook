            <p>The Yearbook this year was designed by the GPA Yearbook class. Each student helped to create at least
                one page spread, gather photos, and vote on design choices. The whole class participated in making this a great Yearbook for 2015-2016. Please congratulate your friends who contributed to this effort (<a href="#authors">pictured below</a>).
