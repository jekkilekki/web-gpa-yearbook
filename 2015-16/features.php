              <li><h6>Year in Review</h6>
                  <p>It's fun to be able to look back and remember the good times you had and the events that were happening. So this Yearbook includes at least <strong>four ways</strong> for you to remember 2015-2016.</p>
                  <ol>
                      <li>A timeline of memorable world events</li>
                      <li>The Vice Principal's letter</li>
                      <li>The Entertainment/Pop culture survey</li>

              <li><h6>Spring 2016 Graduation</h6>
                  <p>After the Spring 2016 graduation ceremony, I added a new page to the Yearbook with pictures specifically from that event. It's nice to see all of our graduates giving their speeches as they get ready to head off into the next stage of life.</p>
              </li>
              <li><h6>Highlights of Student work</h6>
                  <p>There are various sections throughout the Yearbook that show off what YOU have accomplished this past year! From art and science projects, to winning basketball scores, to recitals, photography, yearbook, and putting out fires, you have a lot to be proud of!</p>
