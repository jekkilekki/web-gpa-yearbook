            <p>The 2013-2014 Yearbook project was led by Mr. Thompson as part of the after school Yearbook Activity during the Spring semester. The Yearbook was made in Microsoft Publisher and it looks like every student made great contributions to the project.</p>
            <p>It was divided into two files - the cover page file and the book content - so that it could more easily be printed.</p>
