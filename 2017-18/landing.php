            <h2>Fall 2017 - Spring 2018</h2>
            <p>This Yearbook was put together by the GPA Yearbook class. This is the third year we've had a Yearbook class, so we used the same Yearbook template from last year.
            </p>
            <p>Each student was responsible for an entire section of the Yearbook this year 
              (around 10 full pages each). And with 6 students in Yearbook, that means the students
              directly contributed to 60 pages (or over 50% of the whole thing)! Each
              student also wrote and designed their own articles for the Yearbook on subjects that were interesting to them.
            </p>
            <p>Please congratulate 
              your friends who contributed to this effort (<a href="#authors">pictured below</a>).
