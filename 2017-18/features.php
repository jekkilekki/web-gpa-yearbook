              <li><h6>Year in Review</h6>
                  <p>It's fun to be able to look back and remember the good times you had and the events that were happening. So this Yearbook includes at least <strong>five ways</strong> for you to remember 2017-2018.</p>
                  <ol>
                      <li>A timeline of memorable world events</li>
                      <li>Principal's letter from Dr. Payton</li>
                      <li>The Entertainment/Pop culture survey</li>
                      <li>Yearbook students' articles on interesting subjects</li>

              <li><h6>Spring 2018 Graduation</h6>
                  <p>After the Spring 2018 graduation ceremony, I added a new page to the Yearbook with pictures specifically from that event. It's nice to see all of our graduates celebrating their accomplishments as they get ready to head off into the next stage of life.</p>
              </li>
              <li><h6>Highlights of Student work</h6>
                  <p>There are various sections throughout the Yearbook that show off what YOU have accomplished this past year! From art and science projects, to winning basketball scores, to recitals, photography, yearbook, rebranding efforts, and building mobile apps in JavaScript (AP Computer Science Principles), you have a lot to be proud of!</p>
