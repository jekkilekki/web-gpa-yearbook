            <h2>Fall 2016 - Spring 2017</h2>
            <p>The Yearbook this year was put together by the GPA Yearbook class. This is the second year we've done Yearbook as a class, so we used the same Yearbook template design from last year. Each student helped to create at least
                5-6 pages (totally around 55 pages from the class). The GPA Photography Club provided photos this year, and the winner of the cover design contest was Richard Kim. Please congratulate your friends who contributed to this effort (<a href="#authors">pictured below</a>).
